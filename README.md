## Introduction/Business Problem
The City of Toronto is composed of many neighborhoods. Some neighborhoods are more popular than others. By comparing neighborhoods and the venues around each, the neighborhoods
can be clustered into similar clusters. By looking at each cluster, the most popular venues for each neighborhood in each cluster will help to determine which venues make neighborhoods
more popular.


## Data
The data on neighborhoods in Toronto was scraped from a Wikipedia page. A csv file containing Geospatial Coordinates of the neighborhoods were used to get latitude and longitude
coordinates for each neighborhood. Using the Foursquare API, the venues around each neighborhood using the coordinates are used to compile a list of venues within 500
meters of each neighborhood.
