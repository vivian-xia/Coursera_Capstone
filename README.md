# Segmenting and Clustering Towns in Massachusetts

## Introduction
Massachusetts is the fifteenth most populous state in the United States. As a popular state and home to many reputable univerisities and colleges, many students often choose to reside in MA after completing their education. By comparing the towns and the venues around each, the towns can be clustered by similar and popular venues frequented. This project aims to segment and cluster similar towns based on venues in Massachusetts. The types of venues that are frequented the most in each town are used to cluster towns with one another. The project will locate towns that are similar to other towns and their amenities to allow for a more informed decision on where to move to or stay. 

## Data
The list of towns in Massachusetts was scraped from a [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Massachusetts_locations_by_per_capita_income). The list of latitude and longitude points of the state and each town were found through the Google Maps Geocoding API. The venues within a 500-meter radius of each town were found through the Foursquare API.
