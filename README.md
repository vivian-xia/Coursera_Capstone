## Introduction/Business Problem
The City of Toronto is composed of many neighborhoods. Some neighborhoods are more popular than others. By comparing neighborhoods and the venues around each, the neighborhoods
can be clustered into similar clusters. By looking at each cluster, the most popular venues for each neighborhood in each cluster will help to determine which venues make neighborhoods
more popular.
